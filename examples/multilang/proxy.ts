// The component below is a proxy for the `MyComponent` defined in `./mycomponent`.  This wrapper
// could be auto-generated from a schematization of that component. It only requires:
//
// 1. The filesystem path to the NodeJS module to load
// 2. The (potentially qualified) global symbol to eval to get the instance of the component
//    constructor.
// 3. The input properties to define the `Args` interface above.
// 4. The output properties to define the public properties on this class.
//
// It works by remotely constructing the component in another NodeJS process (or in current
// implementation, VM inside the same process), serializing input properties (resolving inputs and
// promises) down to the standard Pulumi object model RPC, constructing the resources in the other
// process (which is connected to the same Pulumi engine host interfaces), then serializing the
// outputs of that component back through the Pulumi object model RPC into this process.  This
// remote invoke will only complete (asynchronously) once the remote component construction is
// complete (i.e. the `registerOutputs` has been called and it's output properties have resolved to
// concrete serializable values). The only return property we currently care about is the `urn`.  We
// can use this `urn` from within this process to go to the Pulumi engine and look up the output
// properties of the already-registered resource to populate this proxy resource.  This provides a
// lot of consistency with our existing `CustomResource` wrappers for both registered and read
// resources which populate properties based on outputs established by out-of-process RPCs.
//
// The end result is that constructing this component is observably "the same" as constructing the
// real component in the other language/runtime, with the exception that:
// 1. The properties of this resource are the registered outputs, not the host-language level
//    properties.  This ensures that a more clearly defined serializable subset of all host
//    languages can be exposed.
